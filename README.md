# checkpointing-102021
Using checkpointing for resilient workflows on Discovery - the October 2021 session material.

## What's in this training?
* Training PowerPoint slides "Using_checkpointing_for_resilient_workflows.pptx".
* Exercises - practical examples on how to implement checkpointing using different tools and techniques:
  * Exercise 1 - User-level checkpointing example, using Python, Pickle and Slurm job arrays.
  * Exercise 2 - Application-level checkpointing, using a TensorFlow checkpointing example with Slurm job arrays.
  * Exercise 3 - System-level checkpointing, using [DMTCP](https://dmtcp.sourceforge.io/).

## Overview:
* Understand the importance of fault tolerance in HPC workloads.
* Learn about different fault tolerance approaches (Checkpointing).
* Gain practice on how to design resilient workflows using SLURM.
* Familiarize with some existing checkpointing techniques in Python.
* Introduce system-level checkpointing using DMTCP.
